# vmbus_verify_interrupts.sh
#
# Description:
#	This script was created to automate the testing of a Linux
#	Integration services. This script will verify if all the CPUs 
#	inside a Linux VM are processing VMBus interrupts, by checking 
#	the /proc/interrupts file.
#	The VM is configured with 4 CPU cores as part of the setup script,
#	as each core must process the Hyper-V interrupts for a successful test pass.
#
#	The test performs the following steps:
#		1. Configures the VM with 4 cores (see the test case XML definition)	
#		2. Make sure we have a constants.sh file.
#		3. Looks for the Hyper-v timer property of each CPU under /proc/interrupts
#		4. Verifies if each CPU has more than 0 interrupts processed.
#     
#	To pass test parameters into test cases, the host will create
#	a file named constants.sh.  This file contains one or more
#	variable definition.
