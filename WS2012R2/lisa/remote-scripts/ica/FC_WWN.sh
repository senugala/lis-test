# FC_WWN.sh
# Description:
#	This script compares the host provided WWNN and WWNP values
#	with the ones detected on a Linux guest VM.
#	To pass test parameters into test cases, the host will create
#	a file named constants.sh. This file contains one or more
#	variable definition.
#
#	The vFC HBA WWN feature is not supported on RedHat 5.x and 6.x,
#	kernels 2.6.
